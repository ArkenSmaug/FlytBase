# Submissions of Saharsh for FlytBase Assignments

## Known Limitations:
The drone keeps climbing even after entering waypoint following mode. However it was something observed even in the demo apps.

Solutions, would require further investigation into the flytbase code stack which was used the base library for the demonstrations

## Notes about the videos
The video speed was sped up 4x in the interest of reducing size of the file and making verification easy
